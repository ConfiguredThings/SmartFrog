## History

SmartFrog was originally developed by HP Labs Bristol and later open-sourced. It is of the earliest examples of a declarative configuration language and runtime. For more details you can see the following resources:

For a more general introduction to the benefits of declarative configuration management, see Paul Anderson's 2017 "Composition and Inheritance in Declarative Configuration Languages" talk at Microsoft Research, Cambridge. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXo7DtFx-jM>. Paul details the history of configuration management and SmartFrog's role within it.

Following Hewlett Packard Enterprise's closure of its Security and Cloud Lab in Bristol, the company's ongoing support and development of the project was withdrawn.

The project's source code is available on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/smartfrog/).

## Future

In 2018 Patrick Goldsack, one of SmartFrog's lead authors, co-founded [Configured Things](https://configuredthings.com) a startup specialising in systems that enable Smart Cities and the federated Internet of Things. Configured Things are actively developing the next version of SmartFrog, SFJS, built on Node.js with configuration descriptors written in a JSON dialect. To find out more details, you can visit their [project page](https://www.configuredthings.com/smartfrog/).
