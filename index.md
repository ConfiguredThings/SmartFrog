## History

SmartFrog was originally developed by HP Labs Bristol and later open-sourced. It is of the earliest examples of a declarative configuration language and runtime.

Following Hewlett Packard Enterprise's closure of its Security and Cloud Lab in Bristol, its ongoing support and development was withdrawn.

The project's source code is available on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/smartfrog/).

## Future

In 2018 Patrick Goldsack, one of SmartFrog's authors, co-founded [Configured Things](https://configuredthings.com) a startup specialising in systems that enable Smart Cities and the federated Internet of Things. Configured Things are actively developing the next version of SmartFrog, SFJS, built on Node.js with configuration descriptions. To find out more details, you can visit their [project page](https://www.configuredthings.com/smartfrog/).
